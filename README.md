This is **not** a 'clone' based on the famous Urquan game. If you do not know what this game is:

I am not getting into details, but basically these are the macro step for playing this game:

## Game Objectives

1. Make your team
    
    Making your team means you are supposed to choose from a variety of different ships, each with its own special and unique abilities.

1. Wait for your adversary
    
    As you probably imagined, you shall have a worthy adversary. He will also assemble his team from his available pool of space ships.

1. The Game stars
    
    When the game starts, the first two ships of each team is put in a somewhere in space arena where you fight each other. 

1. Kill you Enemy
    
   You may be wondering why would I go to the trouble of choosing a team if I am playing with a single ship. Well, I hope you did not expect to control them all at once!
   What actually happens, though, is that once one of the ship dies it gets promptly replaced by another integrant of your team. So that another round starts between a new team member and the winning from the previous round.

1. Empty your adversary's pocket
    
    After dwelling long enough, you or your adversary will end up short of spaceships and have no backup anymore. That is when the game ends and a overall winner is declared. Remember, do not only win the battle. You should also win the war.
