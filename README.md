# Urquan Clone - Project 2016

This project was implemented for the Game Development Specialization course I am taking right now on PUCPR. The objective is to manually implement the physics and behavior calculation for a spaceship based game, similar to UrquanMaster. 
If you do not know, or never heard about the Urquan game, below are some relevant information about the game:

Please, take look at their website:
[Urquan website](http://sc2.sourceforge.net/)

Or even, take some time to watch a short gameplay :

I am not getting into details, but basically these are the macro steps for playing this game:

## Urquan Master Objectives

![alt-text][urquan-menu]

1. Make your team
    
    Making your team means you are supposed to choose from a variety of different ships, each with its own special and unique abilities.

1. Wait for your adversary
    
    As you probably imagined, you shall have a worthy adversary. He will also assemble his team from his available pool of space ships.

1. The Game stars
    
    ![alt-text][urquan-game]
    
    When the game starts, the first two ships of each team is put in a somewhere in space arena where you fight each other. 

1. Kill you Enemy
    
   You may be wondering why would I go to the trouble of choosing a team if I am playing with a single ship. Well, I hope you did not expect to control them all at once!
   What actually happens, though, is that once one of the ship dies it gets promptly replaced by another integrant of your team. So that another round starts between a new team member and the winning from the previous round.

1. Empty your adversary's pocket
    
    After dwelling long enough, you or your adversary will end up short of spaceships and have no backup anymore. That is when the game ends and a overall winner is declared. Remember, do not only win the battle. You should also win the war.

Before going any further, I wish to shatter your expectations that you probably have for this game. I don't want you to wrongfully imagine that this is an actual Urquan Clone implementation (even though the repository's name states so):

Notice the background colors? Yes, they were arbitrarily picked and you may be thinking that was the result of some kind of glitch on the loading of the assets? You poor fool. I really don't care for that, sorry!
Also, does that brighty colors make you uncomfortable? I don't even aim for that effect, but I feel like I have a natural talent to bring that up in people with my games.
